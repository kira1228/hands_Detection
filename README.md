# hands_Detection
This repository uses Google MediaPipe for hand detection and publishes ROS nodes. When the index finger is raised, it moves forward; when the middle finger is raised, it moves backward; when the thumb is raised, it rotates counterclockwise; and when the little finger is raised, it rotates clockwise.

To run this script, you will need

```
git clone https://github.com/cedro3/mediapipe.git
cd mediapipe/
```
